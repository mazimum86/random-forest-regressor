# Random Forest Regressor

This repository contains an implementation of the Random Forest Regressor algorithm. Random Forest is an ensemble learning method that constructs multiple decision trees during training and outputs the average prediction of the individual trees. It is widely used for regression tasks due to its ability to handle large datasets and model complex relationships.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this implementation is designed for regression tasks. It includes several features that can be used to predict a continuous target variable.

## Contents

- **random_forest_regressor.py**: The main script that implements the Random Forest Regressor, including data preprocessing, model training, and prediction.
- **data.csv**: The dataset file used for training and testing the model.
- **requirements.txt**: A list of Python dependencies required to run the code.

## Implementation Details

The implementation follows these steps:

1. **Data Loading**: The dataset is loaded from `data.csv` and split into features and target variables.
2. **Data Preprocessing**: The necessary preprocessing steps, such as handling missing values and feature scaling, are applied to the data.
3. **Model Training**: The Random Forest Regressor model is trained using the preprocessed data, with hyperparameters such as the number of trees and maximum depth tuned for optimal performance.
4. **Prediction**: The trained model is used to predict continuous values on the test dataset.
5. **Evaluation**: The model's performance is evaluated using metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared score.

## Usage

To use this code, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/mazimum86/random-forest-regressor.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the repository directory:
    ```bash
    cd random-forest-regressor
    ```
3. Install the required dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
4. Run the Random Forest Regressor script:
    ```bash
    python random_forest_regressor.py
    ```

## Dependencies

The following Python packages are required to run the code:

- pandas
- scikit-learn
- matplotlib

These dependencies are listed in the `requirements.txt` file and can be installed using `pip`.

## Results

The output includes the following:

- **Predicted Values**: The continuous values predicted by the model on the test dataset.
- **Evaluation Metrics**: Metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared score that provide insights into the model's performance.
- **Feature Importance**: Visualization of the importance of different features in predicting the target variable.
